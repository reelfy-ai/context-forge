"""Multi-turn simulation tests (Level 3).

These tests use the full simulation harness:
- Personas: Define user characteristics and behaviors
- Scenarios: Multi-turn conversation flows
- SimulationRunner: Orchestrates the conversation

Use Level 3 when you need:
- Multi-turn conversations
- Systematic testing with different user types
- Generative scenarios (LLM-simulated users)
- Complex evaluation scenarios

For simpler single-turn evaluation, see tests/trajectories/simple/
